# YOLOv3-Pytorch
PyTorch implementation of YOLOv3, including training and inference based on darknet and mobilnetv2
## Introduction
The YOLO is one of the most popular one stage object detector. In Mar 2018, [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf), which is extremely fast and accurate has been released. The aim of this project is to replicate the [Darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) implementation. It also supports training YOLOv3 network with various backends such as MobileNetv2, Darknet(53 or 21).
